Take the Red Pill

The Elixir programming language wraps functional programming with
immutable state and an actor-based approach to concurrency in a tidy,
modern syntax.

And it runs on the industrial-strength, high-performance, distributed
Erlang VM.

But what does all that mean?

It means you can stop worrying about many of the difficult things that
currently consume your time.

You no longer have to think too hard about protecting your data
consistency in a multi threaded environment.

You worry less about scaling yourapplications.

And, most importantly, you can think about programming in a different way.
