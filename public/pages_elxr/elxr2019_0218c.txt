Take the Red Pill

The Elixir programming language wraps functional programming with
immutable state and an actor-based approach to concurrency in a tidy,
modern syntax.

And it runs on the industrial-strength, high-performance, distributed
Erlang VM.

But what does all that mean?

It means you can stop worrying about many of the difficult things that
currently consume your time.

You no longer have to think too hard about protecting your data
consistency in a multi threaded environment.

You worry less about scaling yourapplications.

And, most importantly, you can think about programming in a different way.


Combine Transformations with Pipelines

Unix users are accustomed to the philosophy of small, focused
command-line tools that can be combined in arbitrary ways.

Each tool takes an input, transforms it, and writes the result in a
format the next tool (or a human) can use.

This philosophy is incredibly flexible and leads to fantastic reuse.

The Unix utilities can be combined in ways undreamed of by their authors.

And each one multiplies the potential of the others.

It’s also highly reliable; each small program does one thing well,which makes it easier to test.

There’s another benefit.

A command pipeline can operate in parallel.

If I write​​

​grep​​ ​​Elixir​​ ​​*.pml​​ ​​|​​ ​​wc​​ ​​-l

​the word-count program, wc, runs at the same time as the grep command.

Because wc consumes grep’s output as it is produced, the answer is ready with virtually no delay once grep finishes.


Just to give you a taste of this, here’s an Elixir function called pmap.

It takes a collection and a function, and returns the list that
results from applying that function to each element of the collection.

But, it runs a separate process to do the conversion of each element.

Don’t worry about the details for now.

defmodule Parallel do
  def pmap(collection, func) do
    collection
    |> Enum.map(&(Task.async(fn -> func.(&1) end)))
    |> Enum.map(&Task.await/1)
  end
end

result = Parallel.pmap 1..1000, &(&1 * &1)

Functions Are Data Transformers

Elixir lets us solve the problem in the same way the Unix shell does.

Rather than have command-line utilities, we have functions.

And we can string them together as we please.

The smaller, more focused, those functions, the more flexibility we
have when combining them.

If we want, we can make these functions run in parallel;
Elixir has a simple but powerful mechanism for passing messages between them.

And these are not your father’s boring old processes or threads, we’re
talking about the potential to run millions of them on a single
machine and have hundreds of these machines interoperating.

Bruce Tate commented on this paragraph with this thought:
“Most programmers treat threads and processes as a necessary evil;
Elixir developers feel they are an important simplification.”
As we get deeper into the book, you’ll start to see what he means.

This idea of transformation lies at the heart of functional programming:
a function transforms its inputs into its output.

The trigonometric function sin is an example, give it π/4,
and you’ll getback 0.7071.

An HTML templating system is a function;
it takes a template containing placeholders and a list of named values,
and produces a completed HTML document.

Elixir has a CLI:

dan@h78:~/elxr/public/notes $ iex
Interactive Elixir (1.8.1) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> 
nil
iex(2)>

I typed h().

iex tells me that is called: h/0:

This message was triggered by invoking the helper h(),
usually referred to as
h/0 (since it expects 0 arguments).

I am seeing the documentation for the module IEx.Helpers which
provides many helpers to make Elixir's shell more joyful to work with.

I can use h/1 function to get information about some specific things:

h(Enum)
h(Enum.map)
h(Enum.reverse/1)

Can I use Enum.reverse to reverse a string?

I can use i/1 function to inspect values:

i("hello")

Enum.reverse("hello")
iex(3)> Enum.reverse("hello")
** (Protocol.UndefinedError) protocol Enumerable not implemented for "hello"
    (elixir) lib/enum.ex:1: Enumerable.impl_for!/1
    (elixir) lib/enum.ex:141: Enumerable.reduce/3
    (elixir) lib/enum.ex:3015: Enum.reverse/1
iex(3)>



iex(3)> Enum.reverse([1,2,3,4])
[4, 3, 2, 1]
iex(4)> 
nil
iex(5)>

That's better

I assumed that i/1 is a helper in IEx module:

iex(6)> IEx.i("hello")
** (UndefinedFunctionError) function IEx.i/1 is undefined or private
    (iex) IEx.i("hello")
iex(6)>

q: Where is the module for i/1, or what is it called?

This looks interesting:

exports/1      - shows all exports (functions + macros) in a module

I tried this:
exports(IEx)

It worked!

iex(6)> exports(IEx)
break!/1                  break!/2                  pry/0                     __break__!/2              
__break__!/3              after_spawn/0             after_spawn/1             break!/3                  
break!/4                  color/2                   configuration/0           configure/1               
dont_display_result/0     inspect_opts/0            start/0                   start/1                   
start/2                   started?/0                width/0                   
iex(7)>

I tried:

IEx.configuration()

It worked!

iex(8)> IEx.configuration()
[
  colors: [],
  inspect: [pretty: true],
  history_size: 20,
  alive_prompt: "%prefix(%node)%counter>",
  default_prompt: "%prefix(%counter)>"
]
iex(9)> 

This looks interesting:

  • pid/1          - creates a PID from a string

why would I call this?

I tried it:

iex(11)> pid('dan')
** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in IEx.Helpers.pid/1    
    
    The following arguments were given to IEx.Helpers.pid/1:
    
        # 1
        'dan'
    
    Attempted function clauses (showing 1 out of 1):
    
        def pid(string) when is_binary(string)
    
    (iex) lib/iex/helpers.ex:1190: IEx.Helpers.pid/1
iex(11)>

Maybe i/1 is same as IEx.Helpers.i/1 ?

yes!

iex(11)> IEx.Helpers.i("hello")
Term
  "hello"
